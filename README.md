# JavaProj
2nd term project for the "Programming in Java" module

The task is to create a simple 2D Game using the engine provided
by City, University of London based on the JBOX2D engine
for Java. 

The objective of the Game so far is to make the controllable
Walker collect all the coins spawned in the world, which
right now are spawned at hard coded positions, but will
in the future be spawned at random locations on the platforms.

The Game will also implement enemies guarding the coins,
taking away the main Walkers health and stamina upon contact,
and give the Walker the ability to shoot.
